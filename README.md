# Overview

This code represents a basic hotel management system built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for structuring the application.

# Components

Controllers:

roomTypeController.js: Contains controller functions for handling room type-related operations such as creating a new room type and fetching all room types.
roomController.js: Contains controller functions for handling room-related operations such as creating a new room, fetching all rooms, updating a room, deleting a room, and fetching a room by ID.

Models:

RoomType.js: Defines the Mongoose schema for the room type, including the name of the room type.
Room.js: Defines the Mongoose schema for the room, including the name, roomType, and price.

Routes:

roomTypeRoutes.js: Defines routes for handling room type operations. It includes routes for creating a new room type and fetching all room types.
roomRoutes.js: Defines routes for handling room operations. It includes routes for creating a new room, fetching all rooms, updating a room, deleting a room, and fetching a room by ID.

app.js:

Initializes the Express application.
Connects to the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.
Sets up middleware to parse JSON requests.
Mounts the defined routes (roomTypeRoutes and roomRoutes) on specific base URLs (/api/v1/room-types and /api/v1/rooms).

# Flow of Operations

The application starts by connecting to the MongoDB database specified in the environment variables.
Express middleware is set up to parse JSON requests.
The routes for room types and rooms are mounted on specific base URLs.
Each route is associated with its respective controller function, which contains the business logic for handling the corresponding operations.
When a request is made to any of the defined routes, Express routes the request to the appropriate controller function, which interacts with the database (via Mongoose models) to perform the requested operation.
The controller function sends an appropriate response back to the client based on the outcome of the operation.

# Additional Notes

Environment variables are loaded using the dotenv library to keep sensitive information like database credentials secure.
The application follows best practices by modularizing code into separate files for controllers, models, and routes, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
Error handling is implemented in the controllers to catch and handle any errors that may occur during database operations, ensuring a robust and stable application.
Overall, this code provides a foundation for building a hotel management system with functionalities for managing room types and rooms.
